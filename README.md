# GOMUKO
Gomoku is traditionally played on a 15×15 grid where two players alternate placing stones (usually black and white) on the board. The objective is to be the first to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

This project recreates Gomoku using modern web standards (HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript), making it easily accessible and lightweight without any external dependencies or frameworks.
